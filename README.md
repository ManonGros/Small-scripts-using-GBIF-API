# Small scripts using GBIF API

This repository contains a few scripts I wrote to use the GBIF API with python.

## Count the number of species occurring in a list of countries

See for example: [How many butterfly species do we have per continent?](https://github.com/ManonGros/Small-scripts-using-GBIF-API/blob/master/species_per_continent/species_per_continent.ipynb)
