# Small scripts using GBIF API

This repository contains a few scripts I wrote to use the [GBIF API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary) with python.

## Count the number of species occurring in a list of countries

You can use [this function](https://github.com/ManonGros/Small-scripts-using-GBIF-API/blob/master/species_per_continent/species_in_country_list.py).

For usage, see for example: [How many butterfly species do we have per continent?](https://github.com/ManonGros/Small-scripts-using-GBIF-API/blob/master/species_per_continent/species_per_continent.ipynb)
